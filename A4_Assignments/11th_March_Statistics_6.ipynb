    "\n",
    "    A z-test assumes that the population standard deviation is known, while a t-test assumes that it is unknown and estimates it from the sample data. As a result, the t-test is more commonly used when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",

    "    Here is an example scenario where each test would be appropriate:\n",

    "    Scenario: A company wants to know if the average salary of their employees is significantly different from the average salary of all employees in their industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Z-test: If the population standard deviation is known or assumed, the company can use a z-test to determine if the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean. For example, if the company knows that the population standard deviation is $10,000 and they sample 100 employees with a mean salary of $70,000, they can calculate a z-score and determine the p-value to test the hypothesis.\n",

    "        \n",
    "    Bayes's theorem is a statistical rule used to calculate the probability of a hypothesis or event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. The theorem is named after the English mathematician and statistician Thomas Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The formula for Bayes's theorem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",

    "    P(A) is the prior probability of event A\n",
    "    P(B) is the prior probability of event B\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of how to use Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose a medical test is used to diagnose a certain disease. The test has a 95% accuracy rate, meaning that if a person has the disease, there is a 95% chance that the test will come back positive. However, if a person does not have the disease, there is a 5% chance that the test will come back positive. The prevalence of the disease in the population is 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let A be the event that a person has the disease\n",
    "    Let B be the event that the test comes back positive\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A) = 0.01 (the prior probability of the disease in the population)\n",
    "    P(B|A) = 0.95 (the probability of a positive test given the person has the disease)\n",
    "    P(B|~A) = 0.05 (the probability of a positive test given the person does not have the disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)\n",
    "    = 0.95 * 0.01 + 0.05 * 0.99\n",
    "    = 0.058\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we can use Bayes's theorem to calculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "    = 0.95 * 0.01 / 0.058\n",
    "    = 0.163\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, a person who tests positive for the disease has a 16.3% chance of actually having the disease, despite the high accuracy rate of the test. This example illustrates the importance of considering the prior probability of an event when interpreting the results of a test or study.\n"

    "    To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean, we can use the following formula:\n",

    "        z* = z-value for the desired confidence level (90% in this case)\n",

    "    Given the information in the question, we can plug in the values as follows:\n",

    "        x = 65\n",
    "        s = 8\n",
    "        n = 50\n",
    "        z* = 1.645 (for a 90% confidence level)\n",

    "    Now, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "        CI = 65 ± 1.645 * (8 / sqrt(50))\n",
    "        CI = 65 ± 1.838\n",
    "        CI = [63.162, 66.838]\n",

    "    Therefore, we can be 90% confident that the true population mean falls within the interval of [63.162, 66.838]."

    "### Q14. In a study of the effects of caffeine on reaction time, a sample of 30 participants had an average reaction time of 0.25 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test.\n",

    "    To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time, we need to set up our null and alternative hypotheses:\n",

    "\n",
    "    The formula for the t-test for a single sample is:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t = (x - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))\n",

    "    To determine the critical value of t, we need to use a t-distribution table with degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 and a significance level of 0.1. The critical t-value is ±1.699.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time. If the calculated t-value is less than or equal to the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Since the calculated t-value (1.8) is greater than the critical value (1.699), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level.\n",
