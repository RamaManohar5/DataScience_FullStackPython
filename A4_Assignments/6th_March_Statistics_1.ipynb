    "            -> In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",

    "            Qualitative data is used to represent some characteristics or attributes of the data. The facts and figures depicted by the qualitative data cannot be computed. These properties reflect observable attributes. These are non-numerical in nature. The qualitative data characteristics are exploratory on a larger end than being conclusive in nature. For instance, data on attributes such as honesty, loyalty, wisdom, and creativity for a set of persons defined can be considered as qualitative data.\n",
    "            Examples:\n",
    "                Attitudes of people to a political system.\n",
    "                Music and art\n",

    "                --------------------\n",
    "                Nominal data is a sub-category belonging to one of the types of qualitative information. Also known as the nominal scale, it is used to label the variables without providing the numerical value for them. Nominal data attributes can’t either be ordered or measured. The nominal data can be both qualitative and quantitative in nature\n",
