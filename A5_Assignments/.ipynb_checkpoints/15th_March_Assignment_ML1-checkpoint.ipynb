    "        Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and solving problems. AI is often categorized as either weak or strong AI. Weak AI is designed to perform a specific task, while strong AI aims to replicate human intelligence in its entirety.\n",

    "        Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of statistical techniques to enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, depending on the availability of labeled data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "            Deep Learning (DL) is a type of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. DL has been successful in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles, among others. DL algorithms require large amounts of labeled data and computational resources, making them computationally intensive and requiring significant computing power."
